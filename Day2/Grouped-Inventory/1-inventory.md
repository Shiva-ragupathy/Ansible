# Ansible .inventory
 it can be written in two formats. **inventory.ini** or **Yaml**. 
 # Inventory.ini 


      server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu
      server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 ansible_user=ubuntu
      server3 ansible_host=192.168.1.12 ansible_user=ubuntu


 ## Use INI when:

   - You're just getting started with Ansible

   - You have a small number of hosts/groups

   - You want a quick, flat inventory

## Use YAML when:
You‚Äôre managing large-scale or cloud infrastructure

  * You need nested groups, complex variables, or dynamic inventory

  * You're using inventory plugins (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.)

 On most Ubuntu systems, the default static inventory file is located at:

   ## bash:

              etc/ansible/hosts
              sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts    # to edit this file


This folder usually contains:

- `ansible.cfg`: The main configuration file for Ansible
- `hosts`: The default static inventory file
- `roles/`: A directory to organize reusable role definitions

# üìù Edit the Inventory File
To manage your nodes, you need to edit the Ansible hosts file on the control node and add a group with the public IP addresses of the managed nodes.

Navigate to the hosts file:

       sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
       [production]
       slave1 ansible_host=35.154.228.102
       slave2 ansible_host=65.2.80.252


* production: This is the group name of your managed nodes.

* slave1 and slave2: These are the hostnames for the nodes.

* ansible_host: Specifies the public IP address to connect to for each node.
# Grouped Inventory
Grouped inventory in Ansible is a way to organize hosts (servers) into named groups in the inventory file. This allows you to managed-nodes and target sets of related machines easily ‚Äî such as web servers, database servers, or all production machines. You can also create groups of groups (called children groups) to combine multiple groups under one name.

## Why Use Grouped Inventory?
 - Organize infrastructure logically (by role, environment, etc.)

 - Reuse playbooks by applying them to groups

 - Apply group-specific variables and configurations

 - Easily scale up and manage large systems

 ## Example for Grouped Inventory

  
    all:
    children:
    webservers:
      hosts:
        master_node:
          ansible_user: ubuntu
          ansible_host: 10.0.0.1  # Private IP of master_node
        slave1:
          ansible_user: ubuntu
          ansible_host: 172.78.0.101
        slave2:
          ansible_user: ubuntu
          ansible_host: 172.35.6.102

    dbservers:
      hosts:
        db_1:
          ansible_user: ubuntu
          ansible_host: 172.89.7.103

    appstack:
      children:
        webservers:
