# üìù Edit the Inventory File
To manage your nodes, you need to edit the Ansible hosts file on the control node and add a group with the public IP addresses of the managed nodes.

Navigate to the hosts file:

       sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
       [production]
       slave1 ansible_host=35.154.228.102
       slave2 ansible_host=65.2.80.252


* production: This is the group name of your managed nodes.

* slave1 and slave2: These are the hostnames for the nodes.

* ansible_host: Specifies the public IP address to connect to for each node.
